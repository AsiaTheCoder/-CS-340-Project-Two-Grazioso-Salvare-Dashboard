# CS-340-Project-Two-Grazioso-Salvare-Dashboard
This repository contains my final dashboard code, README, and a CRUD module from Project Two of this course
## Reflection

### 1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?  
*(Reflect on your CRUD Python module and dashboard work. What were the pros of building this way? How could you use the CRUD module in the future?)*

> I focus on clear variable names, detailed comments, and splitting code into functions and classes. My CRUD Python module was especially maintainable because I kept each method focused on a single responsibility. This made it easy to reuse the module in Project Two, where I just imported the class and used the same methods for database operations. In the future, I could reuse this CRUD module in any other MongoDB-based application—just by changing the connection parameters or adding new methods for specialized queries.

### 2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?  
*(How did you tackle the Grazioso Salvare requirements? How did this project differ from previous ones? What strategies will you use in the future?)*

> My approach is always to break a problem into manageable parts. For Grazioso Salvare, I read the specs, mapped out the required database operations, and thought carefully about how the dashboard should interact with the data. Compared to previous assignments, this project required more focus on user experience and real-world usability. In the future, I’ll keep using strategies like data modeling, modular code, and iterative testing to meet client needs.

### 3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?  
*(How would your work on this project help a company like Grazioso Salvare?)*

> Computer scientists solve real-world problems by building systems that help people make smarter decisions. In this project, my work would help Grazioso Salvare quickly identify and train dogs for rescue, saving both time and lives. The ability to turn raw data into actionable insights is what makes computer science so important in every industry.
