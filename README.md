# CS-340-Project-Two-Grazioso-Salvare-Dashboard
This repository contains my final dashboard code, README, and a CRUD module from Project Two of this course

## Reflection

### 1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?  
*(Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?)*

> I make sure to create meaningful variable, that I make detailed comments explaining, and splitting code into functions and classes. My CRUD Python module was especially maintainable because I kept each method focused on a single responsibility. This made it easy to reuse the module in Project Two, where I just imported the class and used the same methods for database operations. In the future, I could reuse this CRUD module in any other MongoDB based application, just by changing the connection parameters or adding new methods for queries.

### 2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?  
*(Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?)*

> My approach is always to break a problem into manageable parts. For Grazioso Salvare, I read the specs, mapped out the required database operations, and thought carefully about how the dashboard should interact with the data. Compared to previous assignments, this project required more focus on user experience and real world usability. In the future, I’ll keep using strategies like data modeling, modular code, and iterative testing to meet client needs.

### 3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?  
*(How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?)*

> Computer scientists help people and organizations make better decisions by organizing information and building tools that turn raw data into something useful. For a company like Grazioso Salvare, this means quickly finding the right dogs for rescue, which can make a real difference in their work and in people’s lives.
